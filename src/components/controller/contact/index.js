    descr: `I am a full stack data scientist. I arrived here after becoming increasingly capable at quantitative methods. While an urban economist I was pulled toward advanced ML techniques, initially using frameworks in R and then Python. Eventually I found that the presentation of data analysis was critical to its understanding and impact. I began to specialize in data visualization techniques using JavaScript. I took a hard vere into software development and startups after working at the World Bank. I was excited about the potential of web3, enabling investments in creative urban development ideas, and mobilizing private networks and so embarked on building a blockchain start-up focused on tokenizing the equity in real estate. In building this project I gained a foundation for blockchain engineering, data engineering, and backend development. When the start-up did not pan out for financial and legal reasons, I shifted to a well-financed analytics start-up, Elementus. There I developed dynamic and interactive analytical products and learned a lot more about the blockchain ecosystem.

    Historically I have been keen on projects that solve systemic economic problems. I am curious about applications for web3, particularly in the context of the mobilization of private networks. I am also a big urban planning geek, so I would jump at an opportunity to work on projects that shape the built environment.  That said, my key priority is joining a company with a grounded business strategy and a stable, even if modest, revenue stream in rapidly evolving industries. Regardless of what I build and where I work, itâ€™s critical that I am dealing with smart but humble personas passionate about the specific economic issues/problems they are grappling with, in an inclusive supportive work culture.

    In my personal time I spend an inordinate amount of time reading scientific studies and summaries for maximizing health outcomes. Lately I have been keen on dopamine fasting and other methods for streamlining dopamine for long periods of optimal focus and motivation.

    I do not have strong philosophical convictions but would consider myself a fan of stoicicism.
        
    I find solace in running and swimming.
        
    I spend my nights fighting back thoughts on implementation ideas for projects I will never likely get to and so I journal about them instead.
