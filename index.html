I organized a series of talks called "queerly classed," which covered issues surrounding immigrant rights for queer folk, complexities of the fight for marriage rights in the queer community, and the displacement associated with gentrification within queer neighborhoods. These talks were hosted in conjunction with community organizers and academics.</p>

					<div class="main-summary">
						<p class="name">MAT STEELE</p>
						<p class="bio">An urban economist focused on public-private real estate finance and development. He has four years of experience in project management, community development  finance, and economic consulting and is adept in using a wide range of quantitative tools and analytical methods, especially involving spatial analysis.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p class="icoText1">I went to graduate school to pursue my interest in real estate development finance, and urban economics. I developed skills in financial and economic modeling. These skills gave me insights into understanding and visualizing how markets shift and change in response to movements in demand, innovation and planning. My academic track was public private development, which means I learned how to employ strategies and techniques that leverage private investment for infrastructure development and city building.</p>
					<p class="icoText2">I was also admitted into a data science masters program at Penn. My data modeling and web development courses were my favorites. I became a wiz at R and Python and learned how to use every aspect of ArcGIS. My coursework involved advanced statistics and spatial statistics as well as design coursework for data visualizations.</p>
					<p class="icoText3">While graduate school built my technical skills, my undergraduate studies honed my abstract skills. It was as an economics major that I was first exposed to corporate finance and broad economic theory. I was also accepted into an interdisciplinary program for intrinsically motivated students called Community and Environmental Planning (CEP). Every aspect of CEP was devised for and by students. The open-dialogue format of our classes cultivated my ability to think critically and argue compassionately. We built strong connections with our professors, who supported us to take on ambitious projects and engage meaningfully with city and university institutions.</p>
					<p class="icoText4">I coordinated the World Bank’s technical assistance program for urban planning in Indonesia.  In this work I hired and managed three teams of international and local planning consultants, reflecting contracts worth $500,000 USD. I projected budgets, established KPIs, and drafted the terms of reference and work plans for 29 consultants.  I helped 5 cities implement data systems. I also worked closely with local planning officials to use what data was available to conduct analysis on urban expansion, land use/change, infrastructure accessibility, transit-oriented development, and slum upgrading strategies in order to guide infrastructure investments.</p>
					<p class="icoText5">I conducted data mining, data visualization, and real estate economic analyses for large development projects in the Eastern United States. The largest market study I undertook was in support of a public/private transit oriented development (TOD) project for modeling housing and office space prospects in Hyattsville, Maryland.  I also provided an economic impact study for a retail strategy of downtown Bethesda, Maryland and  developed and managed  all analytical inputs for the 2014 Baltimore Regional Housing Plan.</p>
					<p class="icoText6">I was placed at TRF as a Wharton Social Impact Fellow. I worked broadly in the finance department, the lending department, and in our in-house think tank on various ad-hoc projects.  Most of my time was spent structuring analytical models to understand the quantifiable development impacts of our lending through the Fresh Food Financing Initiative and the New Market Tax Credit programs. For the finance department I built models for tracking and evaluating our various business lines. My primary role was as a quant, but I also assisted with developing applications and presentation materials. </p>
					<p class="icoText7">I partnered with the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) to research the prospects of a capital fund for cooperative development. To explore prospects for the fund, I conducted economic research on the risk/return profile of potential business investments. I also drafted a policy brief on the legal parameters of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). My final project was to conduct a portfolio review, analyzing Calvert’s current holdings in cooperative ventures.</p>
